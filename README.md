# RNoBot
### A Snarky Twitter Bot
 When the discourse is this stupid, all you can do is make fun of it.
 
 Uses plural nouns from the Wordnik API and book titles from the New York Times Books API to highlight the absurdity of transphobic social media discourse.

## Moving to Mastodon

RNoBot is no longer posting to Twitter, and the @RNoBot232 account will be deactivated soon. I intend to update the bot for Mastodon, but I'm not sure when that will happen.
